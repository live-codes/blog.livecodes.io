import LiveCodes from '../../src/components/LiveCodes.tsx';

LiveCodes is here!

After years of hard work, I'm thrilled to announce the release of LiveCodes, a feature-rich, open-source, client-side, code playground that supports 80+ languages and frameworks. These include React, Vue, Svelte, SolidJS, Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, C++, and many more!
